## Week One - Module 3 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week (which is a TON!). 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What is `json` and why is it important?
Json stands for javascript object notation and it is important because it stores data efficiently and stikes a balance between being human readable and machine readable.
2. What's the difference between `joins` and `includes` in ActiveRecord?
Joins uses lazy loading and includes uses eager loading.
3. What's an API?
Api stands for application program interface and is used to access or share data with 3rd parties (or at times internally).
4. How do we test an internal API (in general)?
The best way we've learned to test an internal API is using request tests.
5. What are two different ways to customize your `json`?
To customize our json we can use serializers or jbuilder.
